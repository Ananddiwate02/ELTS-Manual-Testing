# ELTS-Manual-Testing

## Overview
The **ELTS-Manual-Testing** project is designed to guide and document the manual testing process for the ELTS (Extended Learning & Testing System). This repository includes testing plans, test cases, bug reports, and manual testing workflows.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to ensure that all features and functionalities of the ELTS platform are rigorously tested to maintain high-quality standards. It covers various aspects such as:

- Functional Testing
- Usability Testing
- Regression Testing
- Performance Testing (Manual)
- Compatibility Testing (Manual)

## Prerequisites
Before starting manual testing, ensure the following:

- **Access to ELTS Platform**: You should have the appropriate login credentials and permissions to access the platform for testing purposes.
- **Test Environment Setup**: Ensure that the test environment mirrors the production setup as closely as possible.
- **Browser Setup**: Ensure that you have the necessary browsers installed for cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).

## Testing Process

### 1. Functional Testing
Functional testing ensures that the ELTS application behaves as expected. This includes:

- **Login and Registration**: Verify that users can log in and register successfully.
- **User Dashboard**: Check if the dashboard loads correctly and all functionalities (e.g., course access, test history) work as intended.
- **Course Completion**: Verify that users can complete courses and track progress.

### 2. Usability Testing
Ensure that the system is intuitive and user-friendly. This includes:

- Checking for easy navigation between pages and sections.
- Evaluating user interface design and responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Verifying error messages and help sections are clear and helpful.

### 3. Regression Testing
Regression testing ensures that new updates or changes do not break existing functionality. It includes:

- Retesting of core features like login, course management, and test submissions after every update or modification.
- Re-checking previously identified issues to ensure they are resolved and have not reoccurred.

### 4. Performance Testing (Manual)
Manual performance testing includes verifying:

- **Page Load Times**: Check how long different pages take to load.
- **Stress Testing**: Identify how the system performs under heavy load by simulating multiple users accessing the platform at the same time.

### 5. Compatibility Testing
Test the application across multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility. This includes:

- Verifying that the application works on major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Testing across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness and accessibility.

## Test Case Management
Test cases should be written for each functionality, and the status of each test (Passed, Failed, Blocked, etc.) should be documented. A sample test case format is as follows:

- **Test Case ID**: TC_001
- **Test Description**: User should be able to log in using valid credentials.
- **Preconditions**: User has a registered account.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the ELTS login page.
  2. Enter valid credentials (username and password).
  3. Click on the 'Login' button.
- **Expected Result**: User should be redirected to the dashboard.
- **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

## Bug Reporting
Any issues or bugs found during testing should be reported in the **Issues** section of this repository. Please provide the following information when reporting a bug:

- **Bug Description**: A clear and concise description of the issue.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Include the exact steps to reproduce the issue.
- **Expected Behavior**: What was supposed to happen.
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened.
- **Screenshots or Videos**: If applicable, include supporting media.
- **Environment**: Specify the OS, browser, and version of the ELTS platform being tested.

## Test Execution Schedule
Testing should be performed in the following order:

1. **Initial Testing**: Perform basic functionality testing and verify the core features.
2. **Intermediate Testing**: After code changes or updates, perform regression and performance testing.
3. **Final Testing**: Before a release, conduct compatibility, usability, and load testing.
4. **Post-release**: Continue monitoring for bugs and user feedback.
